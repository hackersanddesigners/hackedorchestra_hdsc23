# Hacked Orchestra - HDSC 2023

These are the components kits and instructions for the Hacked Orchestra workshop during summer camp 2023. We are highly indebted to Nic Collins' fun experiments from the book [Handmade Electronic Music](https://www.nicolascollins.com/handmade.htm). 

A mini guitar amp is provided with all the kits, this is powered with a 9V battery for the moment. In the future we could try and find ways to power it with renewable energy. 

These are very basic recipes to turn "signals" around us into sound. It's up to you to explore what kind of possible instrument you could make with this and how (and by whom or by what) they should be played.

## Electromagnetic

 With this basic tool you can audio sniff all sorts of sounds from electronic devices. You are capturing a parasitic signal from the electromagnetic fields created by powered devices such as laptops, fridges, routers.

## Pressure  

 With this basic tool you can audio sniff all sorts of sound created by pressure on the piezo disk. This ceramic disk generates small electric pulses when forces is applied to it (e.g. knocking, bending).

## Dynamos
 
 With this setup you can use any DC motor to create sounds. A moto spins when you apply power, but the reverse also applies: if you turn a motor shaft you generate a bit of electricity that can be amplified as sound. We salvaged a bunch from bicycle dynamos, toys and sound recorders you can explore.

## Solar sounds

This basic tool uses an electret microphone to create signals. These are so small that we need a class D amplifier to make them audible. By powering it directly from a 5V solar cell, playing with light and shadows will give you different sounds. You
